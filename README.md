# Prediction-of-cholesterol-without-lab-test

Goal: Predicting whether a person has high cholesterol or not, based on short questionnaire

This project is based in open source data, taken from 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey' (2014). Features are extracted from datasets related to diet, demographics, examination and a questionnaire. Machine Learning Techniques are used to classify cholesterol as high or normal. 

The project is dealt with in various parts:
1. Feature Selection based on whether it is related to cholesterol or not. (It majorly involves research from various sources availble on net)
2. Data preprocessing - imputing the missing values for numerical, categorical and ordinal data
3. Exploratory data analysis - distribution plots, pairplots and principle component analysis
4. Classification levaraging machine learning algorithms - both linear and non-linear methods. Approx 84 features were used.
5. Using feature importance and extracting 10 most important features to identify whether a 10 question survey could fulfill our criteria of cholesterol classification

Thus, here a set of hundred of questions is narrowed down to 10 questions to identify if person has high cholesterol.
